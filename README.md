# My personal linux machine config

This repo contains all the configuration necessary to bootstrap a new installation and acts as a place to backup the configurations.

## Programs Tracked

### Editing

Mostly [neovim](https://gitlab.com/tusqasi/my_all_dot_files/-/tree/master/.config/nvim) with a lot of lua. A lot of the configuration is copy pasted from various sources.

### Terminal

[Alacritty](https://gitlab.com/tusqasi/my_all_dot_files/-/tree/master/.config/alacritty) Forever.

Got it from [dt's](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles) dotfiles. This guy stuff about terminal stuff is quite useful.

I use [tmux](https://gitlab.com/tusqasi/my_all_dot_files/-/tree/master/.config/tmux) a LOT. This is pretty basic compared other configs I have.

### Window Management

My [QtileWm](https://gitlab.com/tusqasi/my_all_dot_files/-/tree/master/.config/qtile) config is a sight to behold, not that it is good looking or anything, but it is just a mess of files up on file and folders in folders.

Found a folder structure in endevoureos's qtile iso's repos [here](https://github.com/EndeavourOS-Community-Editions/qtile/tree/main/.config/qtile). And then used my qtile config with it.
